The original data is generated through a series of data collection experiments on 30 volunteers while doing different body activities. Activities include `Walking`, `Walking Upstairs`, `Walking Downstairs`, `Sitting`, `Standing` and `Laying`. The data accumulated as a result of these activities is then refined by applying different filters, and segregated into feature vectors. For detailed information of the original dataset refer to its accompanying documents namely the `README.txt` and `features_info.txt`.
